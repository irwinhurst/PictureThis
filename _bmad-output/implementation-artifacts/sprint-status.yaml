# Sprint Status - Picture This Development Tracking

**Generated**: February 7, 2026  
**Project**: Picture This (Web-based party card game)  
**Tracking System**: File-system  
**Story Location**: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts

## STATUS DEFINITIONS

### Epic Status
- `backlog`: Epic not yet started
- `in-progress`: Epic actively being worked on (stories being created/implemented)
- `done`: All stories in epic completed

### Story Status
- `backlog`: Story only exists in epic file
- `ready-for-dev`: Story file created, ready for development
- `in-progress`: Developer actively working on implementation
- `review`: Implementation complete, ready for review
- `done`: Story completed

### Retrospective Status
- `optional`: Can be completed but not required
- `done`: Retrospective has been completed

---

## WORKFLOW NOTES

- Mark epic as `in-progress` when starting work on its first story
- Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
- SM typically creates next story ONLY after previous one is `done` to incorporate learnings
- Dev moves story to `review`, then Dev runs code-review (fresh context, ideally different LLM)
- Re-run sprint-planning to refresh auto-detected statuses (detects ready-for-dev from created story files)

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Epic 3** - Player UI & Controls (Story 3.2-3.4)
   - Story 3.2: Player card hand display and selection
   - Story 3.3: Judge's judging interface
   - Story 3.4: Round results and leaderboard
   - Foundation: 3.1 (player join) is complete ✅

2. **Start Epic 2 in Parallel** - Database Design & Schema (Story 2.1)
   - Needed before persistent storage requirements
   - Can progress independently with Stories 3.2+
   - Foundational for scaling beyond memory-only storage

3. **Epic 1 Retrospective** - Review completed stories (1.1-1.6)
   - Document learnings and patterns
   - Consider architecture decisions before expanding
   - Path: Mark `epic-1-retrospective` as `done` when complete

4. **Track Progress** - Current status: 7/32 stories complete
   - Epic 1: 6/6 stories done (complete)
   - Epic 3: 1/4 stories done (in-progress)
   - Remaining capacity for parallel work on Epic 2
