# Sprint Status - Picture This Development Tracking

**Generated**: February 7, 2026  
**Project**: Picture This (Web-based party card game)  
**Tracking System**: File-system  
**Story Location**: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts

## STATUS DEFINITIONS

### Epic Status
- `backlog`: Epic not yet started
- `in-progress`: Epic actively being worked on (stories being created/implemented)
- `done`: All stories in epic completed

### Story Status
- `backlog`: Story only exists in epic file
- `ready-for-dev`: Story file created, ready for development
- `in-progress`: Developer actively working on implementation
- `review`: Implementation complete, ready for review
- `done`: Story completed

### Retrospective Status
- `optional`: Can be completed but not required
- `done`: Retrospective has been completed

---

## WORKFLOW NOTES

- Mark epic as `in-progress` when starting work on its first story
- Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
- SM typically creates next story ONLY after previous one is `done` to incorporate learnings
- Dev moves story to `review`, then Dev runs code-review (fresh context, ideally different LLM)
- Re-run sprint-planning to refresh auto-detected statuses (detects ready-for-dev from created story files)

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Story 1-6** - Host Create Game Session (ready-for-dev)
   - Depends on: Stories 1-1 through 1-5 ✅ (all complete)
   - Task: Implement createSession REST endpoint requiring authenticated host
   - Integration: Use GameSessionManager + GoogleOAuth from previous stories

2. **Consider Epic 2 in Parallel** - Database Design & Schema
   - Stories 2-1 through 2-4 can progress in parallel with Epic 1
   - Database schema should be finalized before heavy persistent storage needs
   - Recommendation: Start 2-1 to unblock future data persistence

3. **Epic 1 Retrospective** - Review completed stories
   - Document learnings from Stories 1-1 to 1-5
   - Consider architecture changes before proceeding to 1-6
   - Path: Mark `epic-1-retrospective` as `done` when complete

4. **Continue Epic 1** - Complete remaining infrastructure stories
   - After 1-6: Progress to story 1-x (future planned stories)
   - Reference `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md` for full context

5. **Track Progress** - Run `sprint-status` or `SS` to see current progress anytime
   - Shows epic progress, bottlenecks, and next recommended action
