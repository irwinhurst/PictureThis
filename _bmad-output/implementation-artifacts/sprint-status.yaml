# Sprint Status - Picture This Development Tracking

**Generated**: February 7, 2026  
**Project**: Picture This (Web-based party card game)  
**Tracking System**: File-system  
**Story Location**: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts

---

## STATUS DEFINITIONS

### Epic Status
- `backlog`: Epic not yet started
- `in-progress`: Epic actively being worked on (stories being created/implemented)
- `done`: All stories in epic completed

### Story Status
- `backlog`: Story only exists in epic file
- `ready-for-dev`: Story file created, ready for development
- `in-progress`: Developer actively working on implementation
- `review`: Implementation complete, ready for review
- `done`: Story completed

### Retrospective Status
- `optional`: Can be completed but not required
- `done`: Retrospective has been completed

---

## WORKFLOW NOTES

- Mark epic as `in-progress` when starting work on its first story
- Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
- SM typically creates next story ONLY after previous one is `done` to incorporate learnings
- Dev moves story to `review`, then Dev runs code-review (fresh context, ideally different LLM)
- Re-run sprint-planning to refresh auto-detected statuses (detects ready-for-dev from created story files)

## Next Steps

1. **Review epics.md** - Read the complete epic definitions and stories
   - Path: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`

2. **Start First Epic** - Create story 1-1 to begin Core Infrastructure
   - Run: `create-story` or `CS` command
   - Story: `1-1-game-server-websocket-setup`
   - Result: Creates detailed dev story with full context

3. **Parallel: Database** - Consider starting Epic 2 earliest (Story 2.1) in parallel
   - Database schema should be finalized before heavy use of server (Epic 1.2+)
   - Stories: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 can be done before 1.2

4. **Continue Development** - Create subsequent stories as previous ones complete
   - Watch this file auto-update as stories are created (migrate from `backlog` to `ready-for-dev`)

5. **Track Progress** - Run `sprint-status` or `SS` to see current progress anytime
   - Shows epic progress, bottlenecks, and next recommended action
